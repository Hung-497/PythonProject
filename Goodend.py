It just… quiets. You walk outside the terminal, past empty halls and forgotten signs, until you find the same bench where it all began. The sky is painted in soft evening light. You lie down, not as a savior, but as someone who finally understands. Some battles can’t be won, and accepting that might be the only real victory left.')
